/// Algorithms definining a kind of counter.
///
/// Implementations of this trait describes a kind of counter (usually, some
/// kind of probability counter, AKA cardinality estimator). Instances contains
/// usually parameters that further define the counter behavior.
///
/// The trait contain the following items:
///
/// * Three associated types:
///     - `Item`: the type of items the counter accepts.
///     - `Backend`: the type of the counter backend, that is, the raw, concrete
///       representation of the counter state.
///     - `Counter<'a>`: the type of a counter of this kind.
/// * A method to create a new counter:
///   [`new_counter`](CounterLogic::new_counter).
/// * A method to add elements to a backend: [`add`](CounterLogic::add).
/// * Methods to manipulate backends: [`count`](CounterLogic::count),
///   [`clear`](CounterLogic::clear), and [`set`](CounterLogic::set).
///
/// By providing methods based on backends, a `CounterLogic` can be used to
/// manipulate families of counters with the same backend and the same
/// configuration (i.e., precision) in a controlled way, and saving space by
/// sharing common parameters. This is particularly useful to build [counter
/// arrays](CounterArray), which are array of counters sharing the same logic.
///

/// [create](CounterLogic::new_counter) them and use their methods. More complex
/// applications, coordinating large numbers of counters, will find backed-based
/// methods useful.
