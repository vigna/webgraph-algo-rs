//! Breadth-first visits.
//!
//! Implementations must accept a callback function with argument
//! [`EventNoPred`], or [`EventPred`] if the visit keeps track of parent nodes.
//! The associated filter argument types are [`FilterArgsNoPred`] and
//! [`FilterArgsPred`], respectively.
//!
//! Note that since [`EventPred`] contains the predecessor of the visited node,
//! all post-initialization visit events can be interpreted as arc events. The
//! only exception is the [`Unknown`](EventPred::Unknown) event at the root.
